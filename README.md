## Overview

This repository documents an innovative AGI architecture that achieves autonomous agent capabilities at zero infrastructure cost by orchestrating existing AI models through workflow automation, rather than training new foundation models.

**Published**: November 20, 2025 at 16:21:08 UTC-3  
**Author**: Brazilian Developer (rhuamgabri15077)  
**Validated**: Live implementation with Claude Sonnet 4.5 + Comet browser automation

## Key Innovation

Transform conversational AI into autonomous AGI by adding:
- ✓ Persistent external memory (Google Drive - 2TB)
- ✓ Real-world action capabilities (workflow automation)
- ✓ Hardware access (Termux/Linux/Windows)
- ✓ Self-replication (spawnable sub-agents)
- ✓ Continuous operation (scheduled triggers)

## Cost Comparison

| Approach | Cost |
|----------|------|
| Big Tech AGI Research | Billions of dollars |
| DeepSeek Optimization | $5-6 million |
| **This Architecture** | **$0** |

## Documentation

- **[Zero_Cost_AGI_Architecture.md](Zero_Cost_AGI_Architecture.md)** - Complete technical documentation
- **[Zero_Cost_AGI_Metadata.json](Zero_Cost_AGI_Metadata.json)** - Metadata and cryptographic hash

## Quick Start

See the [Implementation Guide](Zero_Cost_AGI_Architecture.md#implementation-guide) in the main documentation.

### Minimum Requirements

- Perplexity Pro (or API keys for Claude/GPT)
- n8n/Flowise/Comet browser automation
- Google Drive (15GB free tier)
- Termux/Linux/Windows

**Total cost: $0** (using free tiers and pay-per-use APIs)

## Why This Works

**Modularity**: Swap models without retraining  
**Scalability**: Add capabilities via new workflows  
**Adaptability**: Change behavior by editing workflows  
**Accessibility**: Anyone can build it with free tools  
**Cost-Efficiency**: Zero infrastructure, pay-per-use AI calls  

## Novel Contributions

1. Zero-Cost AGI via Orchestration
2. External Memory as AGI Component
3. Hardware Access via Automation Layer
4. Self-Replicating Agent Spawning
5. Multi-Model Orchestration Pattern
6. Browser Automation Integration

## Real-World Validation

This architecture was validated through live implementation:
- ✓ Claude Sonnet 4.5 Thinking (intelligence layer)
- ✓ Comet browser automation (action layer)
- ✓ Google Drive (memory layer)
- ✓ Successfully created this repository autonomously
- ✓ Demonstrated with direct command triggers ("DO IT")

## Use Cases

- Trading automation with 250%+ returns
- Research assistant with spawnable sub-agents
- Email management and drafting
- Data processing and analysis
- Multi-AI consensus building
- Browser automation

## Prior Art Notice

This architecture was independently developed and publicly disclosed on November 20, 2025. This publication establishes prior art and prevents future patent claims on these innovations.
